>This mobile application enables users to upload files for sign language analysis or to receive real-time interpretation, simplifying the process of learning sign language.
>
> Silent Learning is an app that helps people learn sign language. It gives feedback to help learners improve. There are two parts: one for students to learn and one for teachers to add new signs, which keeps the app's sign language collection fresh and full.


### User Stories
- As a user, I want to easily understand sign language so that I can accommodate those with hearing and speaking disabilities.
- As a registered teacher, I want to ensure that the app has the most up-to-date word bank so that anyone using the app can express themselves properly.
- As a system admin, I want to manage teacher accounts so that I can ensure the smooth operation of the translation service and maintain data security.

<!-- Tech stack -->

###  Silent Learning is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the Mediapipe and Tensorflow integarted with Flutter to create a wireframe that tracks the user's hand and body movements to correctly interpret the signs being done.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the MongoDB package which allows the app to connect to a database containing all the users.
- The Tensorflow package comes equiped with Keras which allows us to load in the models and update them without the need for a deticated databse.

> We designed Silent Learning using wireframes and mockups, iterating on the design until we reached the ideal layout for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.
