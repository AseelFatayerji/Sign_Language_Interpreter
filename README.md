>This mobile application enables users to upload files for sign language analysis or to receive real-time interpretation, simplifying the process of learning sign language.
>
> Silent Learning is designed to assist individuals eager to learn and instruct in sign language. Its live interpretation feature enables learners to monitor their advancement and receive constructive feedback for enhancement. Additionally, the app offers two distinct modes: a Learning Mode for students and a Teaching Mode for educators. The latter permits instructors to expand the app's database by incorporating new signs, ensuring the content remains current and comprehensive.

### User Stories
- As a student, I want to practice sign language and receive guidance to improve.
- As a teacher, I want to make sure that my students can practice sign language in my absence and have the most up-to-date information possible.

<!-- Tech stack -->

###  Silent Learning is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the Mediapip and OpenCV packages in Python to create a wireframe that tracks the user's hand and body movements to correctly interpret the signs being done.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the MySQL package which allows the app to connect to a database containing all the signs as well as add to it.

> We designed Silent Learning using wireframes and mockups, iterating on the design until we reached the ideal layout for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.
